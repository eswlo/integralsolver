<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


1. In SIW-Prolog, set the work directoory to where the folder _integralsolver_ is located.
2. Run the following:
   ```sh
   [main].
   ```
3. Enter the following to begin the program:
   ```sh
   begin.
   ```
4. Refer to the file containing tests for some examples.

<!-- NOTES -->
## Notes
* The application currently supports integration of functions of one variable only.
* Option 1 (finding anti-derivative) and option 2 (computing definite integrals) currently support the following non-exhaustive functions:
  * Constant, polynomial, and power functions
  * Trigonometric and logarithmic functions
  * e^x
* Option 3 (solving initial-value problems) currently support the following non-exhaustive functions:
  * Constant, polynomial, power, and logarithmic functions
  * Trigonometric functions, except for tan & cot
  * e^x
